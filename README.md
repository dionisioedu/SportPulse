# SportPulse

A real-time sports score aggregator leveraging C++ for high-performance processing, deployed on AWS with modern Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) practices. SportPulse fetches live data from TheSportsDB API, computes real-time statistics, and aims to deliver a scalable, reliable, and monetizable solution.

## Overview

SportPulse is designed to showcase advanced technical skills in low-latency backend development and SRE principles. The project features a C++ core for processing live sports data, a cloud-based deployment, and a frontend (to be determined) for user interaction. With a focus on automation, observability, and resilience, it serves as both a professional portfolio piece and a foundation for future monetization through ads or premium subscriptions.

## Key Features

- **Backend**: Real-time processing of sports scores and statistics (e.g., goal averages) using C++.
- **Update Frequency**: Live scores refreshed every 5 seconds with <500ms latency.
- **Cloud Deployment**: Hosted on AWS ECS with load balancing and scalability.
- **SRE Practices**: Monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana, automated CI/CD via GitHub Actions, and fault tolerance.
- **Frontend**: TBD (initially CLI, with plans for REST API or web interface).
